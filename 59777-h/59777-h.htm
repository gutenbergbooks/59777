<p>With the production of &#8220;The Detour,&#8221; about a year
ago, I managed to secure some measure of success in
drawing a simple picture of life as it is lived on a Long
Island farm; encouraged by this, I am now turning
toward my own people, the people of northern New
England, whose folklore, up to the present time, has
been quite neglected in our theatre. I mean, of course,
that few serious attempts have been made in the direction
of a genre comedy of this locality. Here I have
at least tried to draw a true picture of these people, and
I am of their blood, born of generations of Northern
Maine, small-town folk, and brought up among them.
In my memory of them is little of the &#8220;Rube&#8221; caricature
of the conventional theatre; they are neither buffoons
nor sentimentalists, and at least neither their
faults nor their virtues are borrowed from the melting
pot but are the direct result of their own heritage and
environment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ACT ONE</h2></div>


<p><i>Scene: The parlor of the Jordan Homestead at
Venzie, Maine.</i></p>

<p><i>It is late October, and through the two windows at
the back one may see a bleak countryside, the grass
brown and lifeless, and the bare limbs of the trees
silhouetted against a gray sky. Here, in the room
that for a hundred years has been the rallying point of
the Jordan family, a group of relatives are gathered to
await the death of the old woman who is the head of
their clan. The room in which they wait is as dull and
as drab as the lives of those who have lived within its
walls. Here we have the cleanliness that is next to
godliness, but no sign of either comfort or beauty, both
of which are looked upon with suspicion as being signposts
on the road to perdition.</i></p>

<p><i>In this group are the following characters: Henry
Jordan, a heavy set man of fifty, worn by his business
cares into a dull sort of hopeless resignation. Emma,
his wife, a stout and rather formidable woman of forty,
with a look of chronic displeasure; Nettie, her daughter
by a former marriage, a vain and shallow little rustic
beauty; Sadie, a thin, tight-lipped woman of forty, a
widow and a gossip; Orin, her son, a pasty-faced boy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<i>of ten with large spectacles; Ella, a &#8220;Maiden lady&#8221; of
thirty-six, restless and dissatisfied.</i></p>

<p><i>Ella and Sadie, true Jordans by birth, are a degree
above Emma in social standing, at least they were until
Henry&#8217;s marriage to Emma made her a somewhat resentful
member of the family. In Emma&#8217;s dialogue
and in her reactions, I have attempted a rather nice
distinction between the two grades of rural middle-class
folk; the younger characters here, as in most other
communities, have advanced one step.</i></p>

<p><i>Rise: At rise there is a long silence; the occupants
of the room are ill at ease. Emma is grim and frowning.
Nettie sits with a simper of youthful vanity, looking
stealthily at herself from time to time in a small mirror
set in the top of her cheap vanity case. Ella and
Sadie have been crying and dab at their eyes a bit
ostentatiously. Henry makes a thoughtful note with
a pencil, then returns his notebook to his pocket and
warms his hands at the stove.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a low whistle of a cold autumn wind as some
dead leaves are blown past the window. Orin, who has
a cold in his head, sniffs viciously; the others, with the
exception of his mother, look at him in remonstrance.
An eight-day clock in sight, through the door to the
hall, strikes four.</i></p>

<p><small>EMMA</small> (<i>sternly</i>)</p>


<p class="p2">Four o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small> (<i>looks at watch</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Five minutes of. That clock&#8217;s been fast for more&#8217;n
thirty years.</p>

<p><small>NETTIE</small> (<i>looks at wrist watch</i>)</p>


<p class="p2">My watch says two minutes after.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well, it&#8217;s wrong!</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small> (<i>acidly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">You gave it to her yourself, didn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><small>SADIE</small> (<i>sighs</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Good Land! What does it matter?</p>

<p><small>NETTIE</small> (<i>offended</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Oh! Doesn&#8217;t it? Oh!</p>

<p><small>ELLA</small></p>

<p class="p2">Maybe it does to you. She ain&#8217;t your blood relation.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small></p>

<p class="p2">Nettie loves her grandma, don&#8217;t you dear?</p>

<p><small>NETTIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Some folks not so far off may get fooled before long
about how much grandma and I was to each other.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small> (<i>sternly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">You hush!</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>Again there is a pause, and again it is broken by a
loud sniff from Orin, as the women look at him in
disgust. Sadie speaks up in his defense.</i></p>

<p><small>SADIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">He&#8217;s got kind of a cold in his head.</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">The question is, ain&#8217;t he got a handkerchief?</p>

<p><small>SADIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Here, Orin!</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>She hands him her handkerchief.</i></p>

<p><small>ELLA</small></p>

<p class="p2">The idea! No handkerchief when you&#8217;ve come expectin&#8217;
some one to die!</p>

<p><small>ORIN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I had one, but I used it up.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>He blows his nose.</i></p>

<p class="p2">After four. Well, I expect they&#8217;ll have to close the
store without me.</p>

<p><small>ELLA</small></p>

<p class="p2">I left everything just as soon as Jane sent me word!</p>

<p><small>SADIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Why should Jane be with her instead of you or me,
her own daughters?</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">You girls always made her nervous, and I guess she&#8217;s
pretty low. (<i>He looks at his watch again</i>) I said
I&#8217;d be back before closin&#8217; time. I don&#8217;t know as I
dare to trust those boys.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small></p>

<p class="p2">You can&#8217;t tell about things, when Sadie&#8217;s husband
died we sat there most all night.</p>

<p><small>SADIE</small> (<i>angrily</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Yes, and you grudged it to him, I knew it then and it
isn&#8217;t likely I&#8217;m going to forget it.</p>

<p><small>ELLA</small></p>

<p class="p2">Will was a good man, but even you can&#8217;t say he was
ever very dependable.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small></p>

<p class="p2">My first husband died sudden&mdash;(<i>she turns to Nettie</i>)&mdash;you
can&#8217;t remember it, dear.</p>

<p><small>ELLA</small></p>

<p class="p2"><i>You</i> didn&#8217;t remember it very long, it wa&#8217;n&#8217;t much
more&#8217;n a year before you married Henry.</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small> (<i>sighs</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Well, he was as dead then as he&#8217;s ever got to be.
(<i>He turns and glances nervously out window</i>) I
don&#8217;t know but what I could just run down to the
store for a minute, then hurry right back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><small>SADIE</small></p>

<p class="p2">You&#8217;re the oldest of her children, a body would think
you&#8217;d be ashamed.</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh, I&#8217;ll stay.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>There is a silence. Orin sniffs. Ella glares at him.</i></p>

<p><small>ELLA</small></p>

<p class="p2">Of course he <i>could</i> sit somewheres else.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>Sadie puts her arm about Orin and looks spitefully

women I want. (<i>He crosses to Henry at stove</i>)

<p class="p2">Why&mdash;I thought &#8217;twas warm enough.</p>

of quiet manner. She has been &#8220;driven into herself&#8221;
as one of our characters would describe it, by
her lack of sympathy and affection and as a natural
result she is not especially articulate; she speaks,
as a rule, in short sentences, and has cultivated an
outward coldness that in the course of time has become
almost aggressive.</i></p>

<p><i>Scene: Sitting room of the Jordan homestead some
two months later.</i></p>

<p><i>This room also shows some traces of a family&#8217;s daily
life, and to that extent is less desolate than the &#8220;parlor&#8221;
of the first act, although the stern faith of the
Puritan makes no concession to the thing we have
learned to call &#8220;good taste.&#8221; The old-fashioned simplicity
seen in such a room as this has resulted from
poverty, both of mind and of purse, and has nothing
akin to the simplicity of the artist; as a matter of fact,
your true descendant of the settlers of 1605 would be
the first to resent such an implication; to them the
arts are directly connected with heathen practices, and
any incense burned before the altars of the Graces still
smells to them of brimstone.</i></p>

<p><i>At back center folding doors, now partly open, lead
to dining room. In this room may be seen the dining
table, back of the table a window looking out on to the
farm yard, now deep in midwinter snow. At right is
an open fireplace with a log fire. Below fireplace a
door to hall. Up left door to small vestibule in which
is the outside door. Down left a window overlooking
a snowbound countryside. The clock above the fireplace
is set for quarter past four. Several straight-backed
chairs and a woodbox by fireplaces. A sewing
table and lamp at center. A sewing machine near window</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<i>at left. A wall cupboard on the wall right of the
doors to the dining room. An old sofa down left, two
chairs at right. When the door at left, in vestibule, is
opened, one may see a path up to the door, between two
walls of snow.</i></p>

some rough towels. Orin and Nettie are by fireplace.
Sadie sits right of center. Sadie and Orin are

<p class="p2">No money!</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">I bet you&#8217;re worth as much to-day as you was the
day mother died.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">To a penny. I&#8217;ve lived, and run this house, and half
supported all of you on what I&#8217;ve made the place
earn. Yesterday I spent the first dollar that I
didn&#8217;t have to spend. I mean, on myself. But
that&#8217;s no business of yours. I <i>am</i> worth just as
much as the day I took the property, and I&#8217;m not
going to run behind, so you see, after all, I&#8217;m a real
Jordan.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small></p>

<p class="p2">Seems so. I never knew one of &#8217;em yet who didn&#8217;t
seem to think he could take it with him.</p>

<p><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well, Jane, I don&#8217;t know as it&#8217;s any use tryin&#8217; to
get you to change your mind?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small></p>

<p class="p2">You can leave that for us to be. I guess it&#8217;s about
the only thing we&#8217;ve got a right to. Get your things
on, Nettie!</p>

I s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll find some way out of it.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I hope so.</p>

<p><small>EMMA</small></p>

<p><small>HENRY</small></p>

<p class="p2">Emma is a little upset. I hope you won&#8217;t mind her

<p><small>ELLA</small> (<i>to Jane</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Poor Henry! Of course I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;re right not
to lend it to him. But I don&#8217;t know as <i>I</i> could do it,
but I&#8217;m sensitive.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">No, it isn&#8217;t exactly a national holiday, but we&#8217;ll
have the turkey, and I&#8217;ll get some preserves up, and
I want you to bake a cake, a round one. We&#8217;ll have
candles on it. I got some at the store this morning.</p>

<p><small>HANNAH</small> (<i>shocked</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Candles?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small> (<i>cheerfully</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Well, I fixed Old Nellie up. (<i>He puts his bottle back
in its place in the wall cabinet</i>) Just got her in

going to be all right.</p>

<p class="p2">She knew what I was doin&#8217; for her too; you could
tell by the way she looked at me! She&#8217;ll be all right,

year before I went to high school.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>Jane crosses into room, shutting the dining-room

<p><small>BEN</small> (<i>surprised</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t like to see &#8217;em suffer.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Why?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I guess it&#8217;s mostly because they ain&#8217;t to blame for it.
I mean what comes to &#8217;em ain&#8217;t their fault. If a
woman thinks she&#8217;s sick, &#8217;til she gets sick, that&#8217;s
her business. If a man gets drunk, or eats like a hog,
he&#8217;s got to pay for it, and he ought to. Animals live
cleaner than we do anyhow&mdash;and when you do anything
for &#8217;em they&#8217;ve got gratitude. Folks haven&#8217;t.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Hand me that sewing basket, Ben.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>She has seated herself at left center by table. Ben

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">It&#8217;s funny, but except for a dog or two, I don&#8217;t
remember carin&#8217; nothin&#8217; for any of the live things,
when I lived here I mean.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I guess that&#8217;s because you didn&#8217;t do much for them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I guess so&mdash;Sometimes I kind of think I&#8217;d like to be
here when spring comes&mdash;and see all the young critters
coming into the world&mdash;I should think there&#8217;d
be a lot a feller could do, to make it easier for &#8217;em.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Everybody&#8217;s always makin&#8217; a fuss over women and
their babies. I guess animals have got some feelings,
too.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>sewing</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Yes.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I <i>know</i> it&mdash;Yes, sometimes I sort of wish I could be
here, in the spring.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">You&#8217;ll be a big help.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;ll be in prison. (<i>He looks at her. She drops her
head and goes on sewing</i>) You forgot that, didn&#8217;t
yer?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">What&#8217;s the difference? A prison ain&#8217;t just a place;
it&#8217;s bein&#8217; somewheres you don&#8217;t want to be, and
that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve always been.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">You liked the army?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I s&#8217;pose so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Why?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t know, there was things to do, and you did &#8217;em.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">And some one to tell you what to do?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Maybe that&#8217;s it, somebody that knew better&#8217;n I
did. It galled me at first, but pretty soon we got
over in France, an&#8217; I saw we was really doin&#8217; something,
then I didn&#8217;t mind. I just got to doin&#8217; what
I was told, and it worked out all right.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">You liked France, too?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;d like to hear you tell about it.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Maybe I&#8217;ll go back there some time. I don&#8217;t know
as I&#8217;d mind farming a place over there. Most of
their farms are awful little, but I don&#8217;t know but
what I&#8217;d like it.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Farming is farming. Why not try it here?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Look out there! (<i>He points out of the window at
the drifted snow</i>) It&#8217;s like that half the year, froze
up, everything, most of all the people. Just a
family by itself, maybe. Just a few folks, good an&#8217;
bad, month after month, with nothin&#8217; to think about
but just the mean little things, that really don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
amount to nothin&#8217;, but get to be bigger than all the
world outside.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>sewing</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Somebody must do the farming, Ben.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Somebody like the Jordans, that&#8217;s been doin&#8217; it
generation after generation. Well, look at us. I
heard a feller, in a Y.M.C.A. hut, tellin&#8217; how nature
brought animals into the world, able to face what
they had to face&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, Ben?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">That&#8217;s what nature&#8217;s done for us Jordans,&mdash;brought
us into the world half froze before we was
born. Brought us into the world mean, and hard,
so&#8217;s we could live the hard, mean life we have to live.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t know, Ben, but what you could live it different.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">They <i>laugh</i> over there, and sing, and God knows
when I was there they didn&#8217;t have much to sing
about. I was at a rest camp, near Nancy, after I
got wounded. I told you about the French lady
with all those children that I got billeted with.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">They used to <i>sing</i>, right at the table, and laugh!
God! It brought a lump into my throat mor&#8217;n once,
lookin&#8217; at them, and rememberin&#8217; the Jordans!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I guess there wasn&#8217;t much laughing at your family
table.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Summers nobody had much time for it, and winters,&mdash;well,
I guess you know.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Just a few folks together, day after day, and every
little thing you don&#8217;t like about the other raspin&#8217; on
your nerves &#8217;til it almost drives you crazy! Most
folks quiet, because they&#8217;ve said all the things
they&#8217;ve got to say a hundred times; other folks
talkin&#8217;, talkin&#8217;, talkin&#8217; about nothing. Sometimes
somebody sort of laughs, and it scares you; seems
like laughter needs the sun, same as flowers do.
Icebound, that&#8217;s what we are all of us, inside and
out.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>He stands looking grimly out window.</i></p>

cotton in that drawer.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small> (<i>looking in drawer</i>)</p>

they was, before the war. It was a nice house.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small> (<i>hesitates</i>)</p>

she stands smiling at her reflection, there is a sharp

<p class="p2">Soon as I dare to; not just yet.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">You have plenty of money; you ought to have every
comfort in the world, and some of the luxuries.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>gravely</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Judge! I want you to do something for me.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">And of course I&#8217;ll do it.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

won&#8217;t go to State&#8217;s Prison.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">But if he&#8217;s guilty, Jane?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I want you to go to old Mr. Kimbal for me and offer
to pay him for that barn of his that Ben burned
down. Then I want you to fix it so he won&#8217;t push
the case, so&#8217;s Ben gets off.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Do you know what you are asking of me?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">To get Ben off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">To compound a felony.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Those are just words, Judge, and words don&#8217;t matter
much to me. I might say I wasn&#8217;t asking you to
compound a felony. I was askin&#8217; you to save a sinner,
but those would be just words too. There&#8217;s
nobody else; you&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to help me.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small> (<i>thoughtfully</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I&#8217;ve always thought a lot could be done for Ben, by a
good lawyer.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">It doesn&#8217;t matter how, so long as it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">He was drinking, with a crowd of young men; the
two Kimbal boys jumped on him and beat him up
rather badly. That&#8217;s about all we know, aside from
the fact that Ben was drunk, and that that night the
Kimbals&#8217; barn was set on fire.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Just so long as you can get him off, Judge.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I think a case of assault could be made against the
Kimbal boys, and I think it would stand.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">What of it?</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">It is quite possible that the old man, if he knew that
action was to be taken against his sons, and if he
could be tactfully assured of payment for his barn,
say by Ben, in a year&#8217;s time, might be persuaded
to petition to have the indictment against Ben withdrawn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
In that event, I think the chances would be
very much in Ben&#8217;s favor.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t care what names you call it, so long as it&#8217;s
done. Will you fix it?</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well, it&#8217;s not exactly a proper proceeding for a
Judge of the Circuit Court.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I knew you&#8217;d do it.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, and I think you knew why, didn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Ever since she&#8217;s died, you&#8217;ve helped me about everything.
Before she died you were just as good to me,
and nobody else was.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I am glad you said that, because it clears me from
the charge of being what poor Ben calls &#8220;one of the
crow buzzards,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t want you to think me
that.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

think you could get used to the thought of being my
wife?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">No.</p>

<p class="p2">I am afraid being happy is something you don&#8217;t
know very much about.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">No.</p>

<p class="p2">It isn&#8217;t a thing that I am going to hurry you over,
my dear, but neither is it a thing that I am going to
give up hoping for.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">When you told me, that day, that Mrs. Jordan had
left me all her money, I couldn&#8217;t understand; then,
afterwards, you gave me the letter she left for me.
I want you to read it.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">What has her letter to do with us?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Maybe, reading it, you&#8217;ll get to know something
you&#8217;ve got a right to know, better than I could tell
it to you.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Very well.</p>

<p class="p2">It&#8217;s here. (<i>She opens drawer, and selects a letter
in a woman&#8217;s old-fashioned handwriting, from a large
envelope of papers</i>) She was a cold woman, Judge.
She never let me get close to her, although I tried.
She didn&#8217;t love me. I was as sure of it then as I
am now. (<i>She holds out the letter</i>) Read it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>reads</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">&#8220;My dear Jane, the doctor tells me I haven&#8217;t long to
live, and so I&#8217;m doing this, the meanest thing I think
I&#8217;ve ever done to you. I&#8217;m leaving you the Jordan
money. Since my husband died, there has been just
one person I could get to care about; that&#8217;s Ben,
who was my baby so long after all the others had
forgotten how to love me. And Ben&#8217;s a bad son,
and a bad man. I can&#8217;t leave him the money; he&#8217;d
squander it, and the Jordans&#8217; money came hard.&#8221;</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Poor woman! It was a bitter thing for her to have
to write like that.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>reads on</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">&#8220;If squandering the money would bring him happiness,
I&#8217;d face all the Jordans in the other world and
laugh at them, but I know there&#8217;s only just one
chance to save my boy,&mdash;through a woman who will
hold out her heart to him and let him trample on it,
as he has on mine.&#8221;</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small> (<i>in sudden fear</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">Jane!</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>reads on</i>)</p>



<p class="p2">&#8220;Who&#8217;d work, and pray, and live for him, until as
age comes on, and maybe he gets a little tired, he&#8217;ll
turn to her. And you&#8217;re that woman, Jane; you&#8217;ve
loved him ever since you came to us. Although he
doesn&#8217;t even know it. The Jordan name is his, the
money&#8217;s yours, and maybe there&#8217;ll be another life
for you to guard. God knows it isn&#8217;t much I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
leaving you, but you can&#8217;t refuse it, because you love
him, and when he knows the money is yours, he will
want to marry you. I&#8217;m a wicked old woman.
Maybe you&#8217;ll learn to forgive me as time goes on&mdash;It
takes a long time to make a Jordan.&#8221; (<i>Jane
drops her hand to her side</i>) Then she just signed
her name.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, Ben.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Well&mdash;that&#8217;s a lesson to me! Oh, she&#8217;s a good
woman! I ain&#8217;t denyin&#8217; that&mdash;but she&#8217;s fickle!</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I been doin&#8217; kitchen police around this town for quite
a spell now, Judge, but from this day on I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to take that sort of talk from anybody.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I assure you that you won&#8217;t have to take any sort of
talk at all from me.</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>He starts for the door.</i></p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I didn&#8217;t mean that. I don&#8217;t want you to think I ain&#8217;t
grateful for all you&#8217;ve done for me.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small> (<i>coldly</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I have done nothing for you.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">If it wasn&#8217;t for you, I&#8217;d want to die; that&#8217;s what I
did want. I was afraid of that prison, just a
coward about it. Now I&#8217;m a free man, with a big
life openin&#8217; out ahead of me&mdash;I got everything in
the world right here in my two hands, everything&mdash;and
I owe it to you!</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I am very glad to say that you don&#8217;t owe me anything.
I don&#8217;t like you, I haven&#8217;t forgiven you for
what you did to your mother&#8217;s life. Nor for a worse
thing, one you haven&#8217;t brains enough to even know
you&#8217;ve done. Don&#8217;t be grateful to me, Ben, please.
I think nothing could distress me more than that.</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">I haven&#8217;t meant to be, as I said I don&#8217;t like you.
I haven&#8217;t any faith in you. I don&#8217;t believe in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
new life of yours. You made a mess of the old one,
and I think you will of the new.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">No matter what you say, you can&#8217;t get away from
me. I&#8217;ll be grateful till I die. But for you I&#8217;d have
gone to that damned prison!</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">But for Jane.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">How Jane?</p>

<p><small>JUDGE</small></p>

<p class="p2">How Jane? Jane went your bond the day your
mother died. Jane took you in and taught you how
to work, made you work, taught you through the
one decent spot in you something of a thing you&#8217;d
never know, self-respect. Worked over you, petted
you, coaxed you&mdash;held you up&mdash;Then you hurt
her&mdash;but she kept on&mdash;She went herself to Kimbal,
after he had refused me, and got his help to keep you
out of prison&mdash;then, against my will, against the
best that I could do to stop her, she turns over all
this to you&mdash;and goes out with nothing&mdash;and you
ask &#8220;How Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Why? Why has she done this, all this, for me?</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>The Judge looks at Ben with contempt and turns
and exits. Ben is left in deep thought. Jane comes
downstairs dressed for a journey with a hand bag,
etc. She enters.</i></p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Good-by, Ben. (<i>She crosses to him, her hand out</i>)
Good-by. Won&#8217;t you say good-by?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">First, there&#8217;s some things I got to know about.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>smiles</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">I guess there&#8217;s not much left for us to say, Ben.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small> (<i>she crosses to door, but he gets ahead of her</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">There&#8217;s things I got to know. (<i>She looks at him
but does not speak</i>) The Judge tells me &#8217;twas you
got Kimbal to let me go free. (<i>He looks at her&mdash;she
half turns away</i>) Answer me. (<i>Pause</i>) The
Judge tells me you gave up what was yours&mdash;to me&mdash;without
no other reason than because you wanted
me to have it. That&#8217;s true, ain&#8217;t it? (<i>Pause</i>) You
sent me every cent you had, when you knew mother
was dying, then you went bail for me, like he said&mdash;and
did all them other things. I don&#8217;t know as any
woman ever did any more&mdash;. I want to know why!</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">Why do you think?</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I sort of thought&mdash;sort of
hoped&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><small>JANE</small> (<i>bravely</i>)</p>

<p class="p2">It was because I loved her, Ben&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">[<i>He turns away disappointed.</i></p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

here&mdash;when you was in France&mdash;then the months
we didn&#8217;t know where you was, when the police was
looking for you&mdash;She used to make me promise if
ever I could I&#8217;d help you.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">No. I won&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;ve done enough; you&#8217;re

know that till just now, but they ain&#8217;t.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">It&#8217;s sort of sudden, the way you found that out.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Oh, it don&#8217;t take long for a man to get hungry&mdash;it
only takes just a minute for a man to die; you can
burn down a barn quick enough, or do a murder;
it&#8217;s just living and getting old that takes a lot of
time&mdash;Can&#8217;t you stay here, Jane?</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">There&#8217;s Nettie.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Nettie&mdash;that couldn&#8217;t stand the gaff&mdash;that run
out on me when I was in trouble.</p>

enough.</p>

<p class="p2">No.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">Then you be quiet and let an expert talk. I was
lonesome and I wanted a woman; she was pretty and
I wanted to kiss her&mdash;that ain&#8217;t what I call love.</p>

<p><small>JANE</small></p>

<p class="p2">You. You don&#8217;t even know the meaning of the word.</p>

<p><small>BEN</small></p>

<p class="p2">That don&#8217;t worry me none&mdash;I guess the feller that

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
